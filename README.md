Role Info for Shakespeare's Plays
====
This is a demo app for a coding challenge. A live version can be found [here](https://lit-escarpment-3344.herokuapp.com/). It accepts an XML document of a Shakespeare play and displays a table with the following information for each role:
* Number of lines spoken;
* Longest speech;
* Number of scenes in which the role appears; and
* Percent of total scenes in which the role appears;

The table can be sorted by each each column using the jQuery TableSorter plugin.
